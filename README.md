**ReIDZoo** is a new fully open-sourced pre-training model zoo to meet diverse research and application needs in the field of person re-identification. It contains a series of CION pre-trained models with spanning structures and parameters, totaling 32 models with 10 different structures, including GhostNet, ConvNext, RepViT, FastViT and so on. 

**CION** is our proposed person re-identification pre-training framework that deeply utilizes cross-video identity correlations. It simply consists of a progressive identity correlation seeking strategy and an identity-guided self-distillation pre-training technology.

**CION-AL** is a new large-scale person re-identification pre-training dataset with almost accurate identity labels. The images are obtained from LUPerson-NL based on our proposed progressive identity correlation seeking strategy. It contains 3,898,086 images of 246,904 identities totally.

Our pre-trained models enable existing person ReID algorithms to achieve significantly better performance without bells and whistles. In this project, we will open-source all the code, models and dataset.
